# hello-world

Hi all! 

I am Manon and I am new into the computer programming world. I am currently doing an Introduction to Programming course where I am learning foundational skills that programmers use. I am wondering whether I should dig deeper into Data Science or Full stack dev, maybe both ;) In general I am passionate about all the ways people can shape a better world, for humans, animals, nature, aliens. Oh and I love cheese. Too.
